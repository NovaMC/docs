# ðŸŒŒ Nova Survival Guide
This guide contains info on how to create sign shops.

## Sign Shops
Place a sign on either a chest or barrel. That container is where you will restock or collect items from your shop.

### The Sign
1. Leave the top row blank, it will autofill with your name
2. Type the number of items to be sold/bought with each purchase
3. Type a **B** or **S** (**B** to buy from you & **S** to sell to you) followed by the price.
4. Use a ? if there is already an item in the chest or type the item name here.
