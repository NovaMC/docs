# ðŸŒŒ Nova Game Night
Following this guide will get you up and running with Netplay, which will allow you to join our game night games!

## Netplay Setup Guide
### Step 1: Download the Emulator
Download the archive below to get Dolphin.
This download contains our custom netplay build, which includes 100% saves, optimized netplay settings, game-enhancing codes and more.

[Dolphin Emulator](https://mega.nz/file/xGghTQDQ#0oEoIl2qN-cXhREGZIMlMsrTEUnN0ViU8l4DX6s6Tes)

7-Zip or WinRAR is required to extract.
You can download 7-Zip from their [website](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html).

### Step 2: Obtain Your Games
Obtain ISO files for the games you would like to play. Check the [discord](https://discord.gg/m52kfmbqAm) if you need help obtaining games.

If your game is a **.7z** file, it needs to be extracted first.

### Step 3: Setup the Emulator
Right-click **Dolphin-Netplay.7z** and click **7-Zip > Extract Here**. You can then move the extracted folder to wherever you would like to keep it. You can launch the emulator using **Dolphin.exe** after placing your ISOs into the included **Games** folder.

#### Gamecube Controller
Go to **Controllers**. Under **GameCube Controllers**, click **Configure** next to **Port 1** and select your controller under **Device** in the top left.
Configure your controls to suit your needs. Some pre-configured profiles are already included, you just have to select the profile from the drop-down menu and select **Load**.

## Netplay Usage Guide
### Step 1: Accessing Netplay
Launch **Dolphin.exe**.

Go to **Tools > Start NetPlay...**

### Step 2: Connecting to Other Players
If you are joining someone's lobby, the host should provide you their lobby's host code.

If you plan to host your own lobby for others to join, pick the **Host** tab and double-click the game you want to host. Click **Copy** next to the Room ID and give it to the players who will join you.

### Step 3: Setting up the Game
Once everyone is together, the host may start the party using Start. The host should set everyone's controller ports before starting. In case of crashing or desync, make sure settings are shared and restart.

## Other Notes
Every player must have the same save file for saving to work. Be sure to run **Replace.bat** from the emulator's folder to replace the saves before every party you play.

Player order is decided by the order of the netplay room by default. The host can change controller ports in the netplay window.

It's possible for multiple people to play from the same computer as long as the controllers they're using are plugged in and the host allows them use of multiple ports.

It's possible to host a room for 4 other people as long as the host disables their controller in Dolphin.

Lag is an unfortunate but necessary part of netplay. The host may use the **Buffer** command to increase input buffer and make the game smoother.

If a save file is corrupted, try formatting the data or redownloading the saves.

Possible desyncs aren't always truly desyncs, keep playing to make sure if there was truly a desync before restarting.

Direct connect may be used even when the traversal server is down, and for players who have trouble with the traversal server at all times it may be the only way to play. Forward a port if the traversal server isn't working for you.
